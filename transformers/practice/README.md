# Transformers — Practice

This section is for **real demos using existing models and APIs**.

Ideas for notebooks and scripts:
- Run inference with a pretrained transformer (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
- Compare different models on the same input (e.g. small vs large models)
- Play with generation parameters (temperature, top-k, top-p)
- Simple tasks: classification, summarization, translation, etc.

These will mostly be `.ipynb` notebooks that I prototype in Google Colab and then sync or upload back here.
